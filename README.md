My C++ Learning Project

Welcome to my C++ learning journey! This project is where I practice and
experiment with C++ concepts, following tutorials and lessons from The Cherno
(https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About This Project

This project is a collection of C++ programs, exercises, and notes I create
while learning the language. Core concepts include:

- Variables, types, and operators
- Functions and scope
- Classes, objects, and OOP principles
- Pointers and references
- Memory management
- Advanced C++ features (templates, smart pointers)

Each folder or file corresponds to a lesson or topic from The Cherno's series.

Project Structure

C++_projects/
│
├─ Header Files/          # Header files for classes and functions
├─ Source Files/          # Main.cpp and other C++ source files
├─ build/                 # Compiled binaries (ignored by .gitignore)
├─ .gitignore             # Git ignore rules
└─ README.md              # This file

Note: Compiled binaries and temporary files are ignored via .gitignore.

How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/YourRepoName.git

2. Open the project in VS Code or any C++ IDE.
3. Compile and run the programs (build folders are ignored in Git).
4. Explore files in Header Files and Source Files to see code examples.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learnings & Notes

I add my personal learnings from The Cherno’s tutorials here. Examples:

- How to use pointers and references efficiently
- Understanding constructors, destructors, and RAII
- Creating modular code with header files
- Using C++ standard library features

You can add your own notes in this section as you go along.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Future Plans

- Implement small C++ projects to practice each concept
- Experiment with advanced features like templates and smart pointers
- Build a small game engine (following The Cherno’s series)
